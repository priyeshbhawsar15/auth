# auth
## Getting started

1. To setup this project, simply run the following command:
```bash
$ npm install
```

It should create a `node_modules` folder, and you're good to go! :)

2. All the routes are setup inside `src/routers/users.js`. Most of your code should go there.

3. To start the project, simply run the following command:
```bash
$ npm start
```
OR
```bash
$ npm dev
```
to start with nodemon

This is a basic authentication API ready with a middleware. The database used is mongoDB which is stored locally on the machine locally.
